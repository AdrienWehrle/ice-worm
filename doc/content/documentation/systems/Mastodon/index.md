# Mastodon Block

## Description
The Mastodon block creates default parameters that are common for most seismic analyses, so that users don't have to manually define them. These parameters include Variables and AuxVariables, Kernels and AuxKernels, executioner settings, output and post processing settings, etc. The automatic creation of these parameters can also be turned off and the parameters can be created manually, if needed.

!!! Note
    The Mastodon block and the associated sub blocks are a work in progress. They will be extended to other parameters in the near future.
