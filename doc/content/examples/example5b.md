# Example 5b: Dynamic response of a simplified 1D model of a nuclear power plant  with mesh generated using BeamMeshGenerator.

## Model

This example demonstrates the use of [BeamMeshGenerator](source/index.md) to create a 1D line model of the simplified stick model of a nuclear power plant taken from the SASSI2000 user manual [!citet](sassiuser2006), described in [Example 5a](examples/example5a). The base-mat is not modeled and the rotations of the stick model are restrained at the base and the same input acceleration time history as shown in [Example 5a](examples/example5a) is applied at the base of the structure. The dynamic responses thus obtained are compared with the dynamic responses obtained from input file which imports a mesh file generated using [Cubit](https://cubit.sandia.gov/).

The mesh is generated by using [BeamMeshGenerator](source/index.md) which generates a 1D mesh from and input mesh text file as shown in [fig:stickmodel5bnew]. Each row following `# Nodes` corresponds to a node and contains the node id, x, y and z coordinates of the node, and nodesets that this node belongs to. Each row following `# Element Linear` corresponds to one Edge2 element and contains the element id, node ids of the two nodes that this element connects, and the block id that this element belongs to

The other sections of the input file are explained at [Example 5a](examples/example5a).

## Results

The response spectra at the top of the internal and containment structures thus obtained are compared with the response spectra obtained from input file which imports a file mesh generated using [Cubit](https://cubit.sandia.gov/). The results using both type of meshing methods are in close agreement to each other.
