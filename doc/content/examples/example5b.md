# Example 5b: Dynamic response of a simplified 1D model of Nuclear Power Plant  with mesh generated using BeamMeshGenerator.

## Model

This example demonstrates the use of [BeamMeshGenerator](source/index.md) to create a 1D line model of the simplified stick model of a nuclear power plant taken from the SASSI2000 user manual [citet:sassiuser2006] which is described in [Example 5a](examples/example5a). The rotations of the stick model is restrained at the base and the same input acceleration time history as described in [Example 5a](examples/example5a) is applied at the base of the structure. The  dynamic responses thus obtained are compared with the dynamic responses obtained from input file which imports a mesh file generated using [Cubit](https://cubit.sandia.gov/).

The mesh is generated by using BeamMeshGenerator which generates a 1D mesh from and input mesh text file.

The other sections of the input file are explained at [Example 5a](examples/example5a).

## Results

The response spectra at the top of the internal and containment structures thus obtained are compared with the response spectra obtained from input file which imports a file mesh generated using [Cubit](https://cubit.sandia.gov/). The results using both type of meshing methods are in close agreement to each other.
