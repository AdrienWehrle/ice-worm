          MASTODON is being developed to be a dynamic probabilistic risk
          assessment framework that enables analysts to not only perform deterministic
          analyses, but also performs probabilistic or stochastic simulations for the purpose
          of risk assessment.

        MASTODON is based on the
        <a href="http://mooseframework.org/">
          MOOSE framework
        </a>
        and can efficiently solve problems using standard workstations or very
        large high-performance computers in a variety of different dimensions,
        including full 3D, 2D-RZ axisymmetric, layered 1D, and spherical 1D systems.
      </p>
      <p class="left-align light">
        Within MASTODON and MOOSE code reliability is a central principle, so these
        projects employ a well defined development and testing strategy.
        Code changes are only merged into the repository after both a manual
        code review and the automated regression test system have been completed.
